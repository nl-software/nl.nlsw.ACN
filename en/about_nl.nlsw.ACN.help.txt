SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes the nl.nlsw.ACN module.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The nl.nlsw.ACN module supports PowerShell processing of Architecture
    for Control Networks (ACN) Device Description Language (DDL) documents.

    The module contains .NET classes for the ACN DDL data model, and PowerShell 
    (advanced) functions for input/output processing.

    The module includes the following submodules:

    - acn.ddl.Device
      The (.NET) data model of ACN DDL and derived device description and
      modeling languages.

    - acn.ddl.Html
      Transformation of ACN DDL documents into HTML.

    - acn.dms.Device
      Processing of Device Management System (DMS) documents. DMS documents are
      an extension of ACN DDL aimed at meta-modelling of embedded systems. Device
      descriptions using DMS can be used for specification, design, and implementation
      (through) automatic code generation of the data model of an embedded system.
